Version 1.91 (1999-210) of Open DCL Lite was released July 29, 1999.
The most noteworthy change is that a bug was fixed which prevented the
DEASSIGN command from working correctly.

We have not received enough questions on the product to construct a FAQ
document, but here are a few of clarifications based on questions so far:

1. In VMS DCL the delete (DEL) key is used to delete characters to the left
when editing a line.  The control-H character is used to go to the beginning
of the input line.  If you are not using an actual Digital VTxxx (VT320,
 VT420, etc.) terminal, your terminal emulation may be sending a control-H
(backspace) instead of a DEL code for the "left arrow" key which is
two rows above the ENTER or RETURN key.  In Open DCL Lite we check to
see if the "erase" character has been set to control-H by the "stty" command,
and if so we map the control-H code to the same behavior as the DEL code.
If you expect a character to be deleted to the left but instead the cursor
jumps to the beginning of the line, you should change your terminal emulation
to send a DEL code or you should use the Unix/Linux stty command to change
the "erase" character.

2. The Open DCL Lite command line processor maps command lines to lower
case, with the exception of text enclosed in quotation marks ("").  If you
wish to specify a file or directory which has upper case characters you
must surround the file specification with quotation marks (e.g. "[.Mail]").

3. Open DCL Lite does not come with any official support, but please report
problems with the software to support@accelr8.com.  We cannot guarantee
a fix, but reports will be taken into account for future releases.
